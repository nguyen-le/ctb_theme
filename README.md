**Work in Progress**

Currently, these colors have been designed for ruby. 

This color scheme improves legibility and allows you to quickly determine what the program is doing based on the colors.
It makes reading nested code easier too.

- class, instance, block, and interpolated variables are light-red colored.
- Class and Constants are orange.
- Loops(while/until), and control(do..end/ return) methods are colored green.
- Conditionals(if/elsif/else/unless) are colored yellow.
