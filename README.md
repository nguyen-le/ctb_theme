ctb_theme
=========

**Work in Progress**

Currently, these colors have been designed for ruby. 
Available for vim. 
Textmate theme incoming.


This color scheme improves legibility and allows you to quickly determine what the program is doing based on the colors.
It makes reading nested code easier too.

- class, instance, block, and interpolated variables are light-red colored.
- Class and Constants are orange.
- loops(while/until) and (being/do..end) methods are colored green.
- conditionals(if/elsif/else/unless) are colored yellow.

***To Add:***
- more syntax highlighting
- tmTheme
