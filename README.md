ctb_theme
=========

**Work in Progress**

Currently supports:
- js
- markdown
- php
- python
- ruby

Only on vim right now, but Textmate theme incoming.

To use:
File should go in your vim colors directory
```
~/.vim/colors/ctb.vim
```
then in your .vimrc
```
syntax on
colorscheme ctb
```

This color scheme improves legibility and allows you to quickly determine what the program is doing based on the colors.
It makes reading nested code easier too.

- operators are purple
- variables (class, instance, block, and interpolated) are salmon colored.
- Class and Constants are orange.
- loops(while/until) and (being/do..end) methods are colored green.
- conditionals(if/elsif/else/unless) are colored yellow.

***To Add:***
- more syntax highlighting
- tmTheme
