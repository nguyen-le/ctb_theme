**Work in Progress**

Currently, these colors have been designed for ruby. 

This color scheme improves legibility and allows you to determine what the program is doing based on the colors.

- class, instance, block, and interpolated variables are light-red colored.
- Class and Constants are orange.
- Loops(while/until), and control(do..end/ return) methods are colored green.
- Conditionals(if/elsif/else/unless) are colored yellow.
